## Prog1
> WAP to estimate a noise function in a noisy image by displaying the histogram of a sub-region of the given input image.

> HINT - Add some noise such as Gaussian noise, Rayleigh noise, Gamma noise, Exponential Noise, Uniform Noise and then have the histogram of corresponding patches of the sub-region of the given noisy image.

## Prog2
> WAP to apply alpha trimmed min filter and adoptive median filter and then display the output with corresponding histogram.

## Prog3
> WAP to apply band-reject filter to remove the periodic noise from the given noisy image
